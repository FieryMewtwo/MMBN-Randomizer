MMBN Randomizer
===============
MMBN Randomizer is a Java utility that "randomizes" a Mega Man Battle Network ROM. Things being randomized include chip codes, chip drops and enemies in random encounters.

To run this program, Java 7 must be installed on your computer.

Usage
-----
```
java -jar MMBNRandomizer.jar inputrom outputrom
```

To use MMBN Randomizer, pass it the file paths of the input ROM and where it should save the output.

Compatibility
-------------
Currently MMBN Randomizer only works for Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Falzar (U), but support for other games and regions is planned.

Notes
-----
* This is still very much a work-in-progress, so many parts have not yet been polished.
